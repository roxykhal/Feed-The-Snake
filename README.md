Technologies used: 

Javascript, HTML, CSS, DOM events.

Next steps: I want to have more time to play around with the css, I did use templates for a lot of the styling as I wanted to focus more on the styling. 

Add animations for winning, e.g. Confetti win winning.

I want to also add lives, rather than instant game over, so 3 lives then game over.

Logic so that the more you eat the faster the snake gets too.
